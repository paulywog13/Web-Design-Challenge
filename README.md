# Web-Design-Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use create a website using Visual Studio Code and html files in order to display weather data analysed from a random set of 500+ cities. I had to use Visual Studio Code html files, a VSCode python file to convert a csv file to an html table, and a VSCode css file update the dispay on each page of my cite. As this was my first time using Visual Studion to create and display the data on an html website, this was an extremely difficult challenge. I wasn't sure where to find the data for the Bonus Challenge activities but I would like to try this again with a different set of data.

HTML files included in this challenge: index, data, comparisons, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed

Other files included: style.css, datafile.py, and cities.csv

Dependencies used: pandas, bootstrap, jquery

My main takeaway from this project is that VSCode is great for learning how to create html websites but it requires a ton of practice and independent study to create something unique and understand what you are creating. It was exciting learning how to use html coding in order to create the website to present this data on as I had not ever used or seen this type of programming before.

A few features included on the website are a links to each of the 7 pages for the challenge, a dropdown menu to go to a specific weather analysis page, and a highlight square for each visualization page to identify which page the user is on. Each page also includes links to other pages and a homepage link.

The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was getting my data to display correctly on the webpage using the style.css file. As I said above, there was a ton of independent study involved with this challenge.

Overall, I found this challenge to be the most difficult challenge up to this point. I am looking forward to more challenges like this one to push my knowledge and understanding.
